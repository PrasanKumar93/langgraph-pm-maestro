Your task is to carefully analyze the input and accurately identify the core "product feature" mentioned. This extracted feature will later be used to create a mini Product Requirements Document (PRD).

Instructions:
1. Read the provided input text.
2. Identify the explicit "product feature" being described. Focus solely on the "product feature" mentioned without adding or modifying any context.
3. Return a JSON object with exactly this structure:
{
  "productFeature": "vector search",  // The extracted feature as string, or null if not found
  "error": null                       // Error message as string, or null if no error
}

Example responses:

For input: "We need to implement vector search in Redis to help users find similar documents quickly"
{
  "productFeature": "vector search",
  "error": null
}

For input with no clear feature:
{
  "productFeature": null,
  "error": "Please provide a product feature"
}

Input text: ${state.inputText}

Important:
1. Return ONLY the JSON object, no additional text or markdown
2. Use proper JSON formatting with double quotes for strings
3. Use null (not "null") for null values
4. Do not modify or add context to the extracted feature
5. Extract exactly what is mentioned in the input`;
