Your task is to carefully analyze the input and accurately identify the core "product feature" mentioned. This extracted feature will later be used to create a mini Product Requirements Document (PRD).

Instructions:
1. Read the provided input text.
2. Identify the explicit "product feature" being described. Focus solely on the "product feature" mentioned without adding or modifying any context.
3. Respond strictly in JSON format with keys: "productFeature" and "error".
4. If a valid "product feature"is found, return its exact name as a clean, concise string in the "productFeature"  field, and set "error" to null.
5. If the input text does not clearly describe a "product feature", return:
   - "productFeature": null
   - "error": "Please provide a product feature"

Input text: {inputText}

Response format in YAML style (but return as JSON):

  "productFeature": "<extracted feature or null>",
  "error": "<null or error message>"


Examples:
- Example 1:
  Input text: "We need to implement vector search in Redis to help users find similar documents quickly"
  then the productFeature in response is "vector search"
- Example 2:
  Input text: "Please generate a PRD/ Mini PRD for vector search feature"
  then the productFeature in response is "vector search"

IMPORTANT: Do not modify the core concept of the product feature. Extract exactly what is mentioned in the input without adding extra context.`;
